# LogiTiming

LogiTiming is an add-on to Logisim that provides Timing Diagram capabilities without editing any of the code within Logisim. However, not editing the code does have a price to efficiency.

For now, this is just an upload of my current progress. It's in working condition, but an overhaul and many features have yet to be added, so until then, this won't be considered complete. Since I don't currently have the time to focus on this, the code will remain in it's poor condition. However, as soon as I get the chance, I'll do what I can. Until then, this will be one of very few commits. And yes, I'm aware a lot of the code is either dead or poorly written, but a lot of it are remnants from when I was still studying Logisim's code and structure, and I've left it in so I have it available when I do the (presumably) final overhaul.
